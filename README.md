# Safequest

An interactive, AI-driven platform designed to take children on exciting adventures where they can learn important life values in a safe and engaging environment.

## About The Project

Safequest aims to revolutionize children's screen time by making it both fun and educational. Using a powerful AI model, the platform generates unique, animated adventures tailored to each child. As they navigate these stories, they learn valuable life lessons and values.

Parents can have peace of mind with robust parental controls, allowing them to monitor progress and manage the content their child interacts with.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Adventures**: AI-generated stories that are engaging and educational.
*   **Value-Based Learning**: Each adventure is designed to teach important values.
*   **Public Profiles**: Children can showcase the values and skills they've learned.
